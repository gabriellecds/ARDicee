# ARDicee 

Want to play with your friends and don't have any dice? This app is for you! 
This is an app made in augmented reality where you can play as many dice as you want, as many times as you want, using the environment you're in, because the app detects flat areas, to be as realistic as possible. 
For this app, I used the ARKit, UIKit and SceneKit tools.
